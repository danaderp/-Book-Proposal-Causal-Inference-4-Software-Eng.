\section{Results}
\label{sec:results-hbn}

This section presents the results for our five proposed RQs. We highlight two P/R curves and focus our discussion on the AP results. However, all P/R curves and confidence interval graphs are currently available in our appendix alongside all experimental data~\citep{appendix}.

\subsection{RQ$_1$ Results: C{\footnotesize OMET} Stage 1 Performance}
\label{sub:results-rq1}


The AP values for Stage 1 of \Comets HBN are provided in \tabref{tab:stage1-4-results} alongside the $p$ values for the Wilcoxon test between Comet and the median IR/ML baseline. The P/R curves for the iTrust dataset are illustrated in \figref{fig:pr1-results}. As \tabref{tab:stage1-4-results} indicates, Stage 1 of \Comet outperforms the median IR/ML baseline across all subjects, to a statistically significant degree according to the confidence intervals. In some cases, such as for iTrust, LibEST, and eTour, Stage 1 of \Comet \textit{significantly} outperforms the median IR/ML baseline, and approaches the performance of the \textit{best} IR/ML baseline. \figref{fig:pr1-results} illustrates the P/R curve for the iTrust project, with performance that outpaces the best IR/ML technique, particularly for lower recall values. \Comet also outperforms the state of the art DL approach across all subjects, likely because the DL approach had difficulty generalizing semantic relationships across datasets.
