\label{ch:conclusion}

We presented \codegen, an interpretability method for understanding \nlms for code. \codegen combines rigorous statistical instruments and causal inference theory to give rise to contextualized SE explanations of \nlms. Additionally, we also carried out a case study evaluation using \codegen on popular \nlms, namely, RNNs, GRUs, and Transformers, to interpret global (\ie cross-entropy) and local (\ie next token predictions) performance. \codegen exposes erroneous code concepts (\eg conditionals, or loops) by examining Average Treatment Effects and refutation methods.
